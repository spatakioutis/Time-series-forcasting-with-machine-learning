Project for a university course in teams of 3 to get familiar with data science, machine learning techniques and time series. The project was developed in Python and it is a complete process from exploratory data analysis to data preprocessing, training a Gradient Boosting Regressor, designing and training an LSTM model and fine tuning a pre designed simple transformer architecture. Lastly the project inlcudes evaluationand testing of all models
